Thank you for your interest in contributing to the OpenCode Obsidian plugin!

## What We Accept

We welcome the following types of contributions:

- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Documentation improvements

**Note:** Core product features and major changes require prior discussion. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/mtymek/opencode-obsidian/issues) first to discuss your proposal before starting work. PRs for new features submitted without prior approval may be closed.

I'm also interested in collecting a set of Agent Skills useful in the context of Obsidian vaults. Feel free to submit an issue or PR with your ideas.

## Development Setup

### Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.3+
- Obsidian (for testing the plugin)

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mtymek/opencode-obsidian.git
cd opencode-obsidian
bun install
```

### Development Workflow

To work on the plugin during development:

1. Build the plugin:
   ```bash
   bun run build  # One-time production build
   ```

2. The plugin will be built to `main.js` in the project root

3. For testing in Obsidian:
   - Enable Community Plugins in Obsidian settings
   - Copy the built plugin to your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/opencode-obsidian/` directory
   - Reload Obsidian or use the "Reload app without saving" command

### Commands

```bash
bun install    # Install dependencies
bun run build  # Production build with type checking
bun test       # Run tests
```

## Before Submitting a PR

1. Run `bun run build` to ensure type checking passes
2. Run `bun test` to ensure all tests pass
3. Test the plugin in Obsidian to verify functionality

## Pull Requests

1. Keep PRs small and focused on a single concern
2. Explain what your PR is attempting to fix or improve
3. Link any relevant issues in the PR description
